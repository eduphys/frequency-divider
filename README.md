# README

This repository contains the schematics and firmware for a frequency divider used in an experiment for time resolved transmission electron microscopy.
The frequency divider can operate up to 4 GHz and is optimized for low timing jitter. The jitter has not been determined by measurements, but calculations using the jiter of the individual components of the signal path lead to <5ps. The input is designed for 90-200mV pp.

The divider can be configured for a division factor of (2^a)(2^b) with a=0...3 and b=0...5.
